# microbiome-prospection
[WIP] Scripts used on my Masters' Thesis: A peek into the sugarcane phytomicrobiome

## Scripts
- pipe.sh: Full pipeline from SRA accessions to Kraken2 counts and assemblies
- check-completeness.sh: Checks and remove raw/intermediate data from complete runs

## To do

1. Upload remaining scripts (Microbial ecology/R)
2. Implement BBMap protocol to fix missing pairs (paired end samples)
